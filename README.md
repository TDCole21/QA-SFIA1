# Hollywood Film and Actor Database

This is a project, worked on independently of others, in reference to the QA Learning Academy training base project specification; Fundamental Project Specification - DevOps Core. The purpose of this project is to fulfill the specification defined for the assignment due Monday 23rd March 2020, 09:00.

## Brief <a name="brief"></a>
This section of the document will serve as the introduction for the requirements of the project.

The purpose of this project is to create an application that involves the concepts learnt from the core training modules; more specifically, this will involve:
+ Agile
+ Python Fundamentals, Testing and Web Development
+ Git
+ Basic Linux
+ Continuous Integration (CI)
+ Cloud Fundamentals
+ Databases

The resulting aim of the project is to produce an application that must manipulate two tables displaying full Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) functionality with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all the above modules.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) <a name="mvp"></a>
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the project has the following requirements:
+ A kanban board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
+ A relational database used to store data persistently for the project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables and are also required to model the relationship using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
+ Clear Documentation describing the architecture used for the project in addition to a detailed Risk ssessment.
+ A functional CRUD application created in Python.
+ Fully designed test suites for the application, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. Must also demonstrate high test coverage in the backend and provide consistent reports and evidence to support a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.
+ A functioning front-end website and integrated Application Programming Interfaces (API), using Flask.
+ Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.

### Tech Stack Requirements <a name="tech_stack"></a>
The Tech Stack requirements are the following:
+ Kanban Board: Trello
+ Database: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) SQL Server
+ Programming language: Python
+ Unit Testing with Python: Pytest
+ Integration Testing with Python: Unit, Database
+ Front-end: Flask and HTML
+ Version Control System (VCS): Git
+ CI Server: Jenkins
+ Cloud server: GCP Compute Engine

## Project Management <a name="project_management"></a>
This section will detail the project management tools and techniques used to plan the project, and how they were utilised and adapted throught the project.

I implemented an Agile methodology over the Waterfall methodology due to Agile's values and principles allowing for testing to be completed in the same iteration as programming, dynamic project aims and working code over comprehensive documentation; again adapting best industry practices.

Due to the nature of my project, some of the values and principles of Agile had to be adapted:
+ Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools:
The project was an individual project, so there was no need for team interactions such as daily scrums.
+ Working Software over comprehensive documentation:
The purpose of this project is to show my understanding of the content taught in the first five weeks.
So comprehesive documentation is important, however, I took adapted this value to mean that the application must be functional over beautiful.
+ Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation:
This project had no customer, other than users and the trainers at QA. So, I imagined virtual users and treated my trainer as a customer.
+ Responding to Change over following a plan:
Although I did not know at the start, the project objectives did not change throughout the five weeks, but my plannign allowed for easy response to change.

### Kanban Board <a name="entity_relationship_diagrams"></a>
As stated for the MVP, I was required to follow best practices within industry and use a Kanban board to manage my project. I chose to use the Trello application to create my Kanban board, due to my familiarity with the software, having seen it used at QA.

The board is designed around user stories to test the CRUD functionailities of the application. These stories are then represented in the product backlog, along with other features needed for the specifics of the project (create this README file for example). These product backlogs are then further broken down in to a sprint backlog, tasks, progress, done and bugs list. These additional lists allow for dynamic progress updates of the project and to maintain specific obtainable objectives throughout the project to allow for a deliverable product by the deadline.

I defined "done" as to mean that the feature had been succeffuly implemented into the application, and had no negative effect on the pytest application which is detailed later.
Any implemented feature that negatively effected the performance of the application were logged into the bugs column.
